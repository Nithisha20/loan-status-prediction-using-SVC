# loan-status-prediction-using-svc

This repository contains a Machine Learning project aimed at predicting loan approval status using a supervised learning model. The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a loan application will be approved based on various applicant information. The dataset contains information like gender, marital status, education, income, and loan amount.

Key Steps:
Data Exploration:

  *Analyzing the distribution and patterns in the dataset.
  *Identifying missing values and outliers.
Data Preprocessing:

  *Handling missing values through imputation.
  *Encoding categorical variables.
  *Feature scaling for numerical variables.
Model Building:

  *Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
  *Training various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
  *Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
Model Evaluation:

  *Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  *Selecting the best-performing model for deployment.

Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Results
The final model selected for loan status prediction achieved an accuracy of 83% on the test data. You can find more detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations in the notebook.

Future Improvements
Further hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Exploration of additional advanced models such as Gradient Boosting or XGBoost.
Deployment of the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time prediction.
